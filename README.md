# smart-trash-cans
for the backend, we have used Nodejs and MySQL. We will store the status of the bins and their coordinates in the database. We have another database to store the coordinates of the trucks which we will get from the GPS chips.

#In the Frontend
we have an angular app that shows the active bins on the Bing maps and a table that shows the total bins their states and their coordinates.
We have also a pie chart that show a visual comparison of the filled and empty trash cans
